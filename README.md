## Introduction

The aim of this project is create a weather app with react that grabs some specific information from open weather API such as temperature and displays to the user. Two different backgrounds were used to display the weather information depending on how hot or cold the weather is. The aim of this project is to practice and showcase my React Hooks skills. Axios was used as the third party to grap the required information from the API and the project was deployed on Github pages

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
